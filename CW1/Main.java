        Rather than creating a new scanner, this utilises the InputReader class that was created by Michael KÃ¶lling and David J. Barnes
        Scanners can only accept one type of data at a time. For example if I was to try and enter a string into the menu scanner, it wouldn't work as its expecting a number
        I need both strings and integers to create a song object as specified by the Song class and having to create three scanners for just one object would make the code look messy
        InputReader will let users input all of these values without having to create multiple scanners in the Main class to do so.
